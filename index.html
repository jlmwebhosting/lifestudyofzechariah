        <p>Welcome to Life Study of Zechariah</p>

<p>The book of Zechariah opens with a word exhorting the children of Israel to return to Jehovah with the promise that Jehovah will return to them (1:2-6). They had returned from Babylon to Jerusalem, but probably most of them had not returned to the Lord. Verse 3 says, "Return to Me, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts." Here we have a principle: first we have to return to the Lord, and then the Lord will return to us.</p>

<p>In this universe we see Christ on the cross as the center, and from that center Christ is spreading Himself to the circumference. This is the universality of Christ. Ephesians tells us that this redeeming Christ who produced the Body, the church, is the One who fills all in all (1:22-23). He is surely the centrality and the universality in God's plan and in God's redemption.</p>

<p>A. In God's Economy toward His Chosen People
1. In Isaiah
Concerning God's economy toward His chosen people, Isaiah reveals that all the nations are for God's chosen people either positively or negatively. God's real concern is for Israel, and all the nations are utilized by God for Israel's benefit, both positively and negatively. For example, Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar was used in a negative way, whereas Medo-Persia under Cyrus was used in a positive way. Cyrus was chosen by God and was His delight. God regarded him as the shepherd of His people in their captivity.
2. In Daniel
In Daniel all the nations are sovereignly under God's heavenly ruling for Israel to be God's witness and testimony on earth. Satan used Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Judah and to carry the Jews into captivity in Babylon. Satan's intention was to end God's testimony on earth with all His witnesses. But he did not realize that among these captives God had four young overcomers. Whatever Satan would do, these overcomers had a way to counter it and annul it. They overcame the demonic diet, the devilish blinding, and the seduction of idol worship. All of Satan's devices merely resulted in God's testimony being strengthened and uplifted through His young overcomers. Eventually, the authority to govern the land of Babylon was in the hands of Daniel and his three companions.
3. In Zechariah
In Zechariah all the nations' dealings with Israel are for Israel to experience Christ in their ignorance. God's concern for Israel is seen in His dealings with all the nations.</p>

<p>C. The Advice to Israel
and the Desire of Jehovah to Restore Israel
The next section (chs. 7—8) consists of the advice to Israel to turn from the vanity of their ritualistic religion to the reality of a godly life, and the desire of Jehovah to restore Israel.</p>

<p>C. Riding on a Red Horse
The Man in this vision is riding on a red horse (Zech. 1:8a). In Revelation 6 the red horse signifies war, which always involves bloodshed, but here the red horse signifies Christ's swift move in His redemption by the shedding of His blood.</p>

<p>D. The Myrtle Trees
Verse 8b says, "He was standing among the myrtle trees that were in the bottoms." These myrtle trees signify the humiliated people of Israel in their captivity.
E. Standing among the Myrtle Trees
in the Bottoms of the Valley
As Christ was riding on a red horse, He was standing among the myrtle trees that were in the bottoms of the valley. This means that He remained strongly among the captured Israel in the lowest part of the valley in their humiliation. Captured Israel was in the lowest part of the valley, and Christ was ready to do anything for them swiftly. Christ, the One on the red horse, was their patron taking care of them in their captivity.
F. Behind the Angel of Jehovah, There Being
Red, Reddish-brown, and White Horses
"Behind Him there were red, reddish-brown, and white horses" (v. 8c). Christ was riding on a red horse, and following Him were horses of three different colors. This indicates that Christ's redemption (the red horse) leads the repentant Israel (the reddish-brown horses) to be justified and accepted by God swiftly (the white horses). Although they were the redeemed people of God (the red horses), as the reddish-brown horses indicate, they were not that pure but were a mixture. The word reddish indicates redemption, and the word brown indicates a mixture. Eventually, as signified by the white horses, when the redeemed people of God come to God and are dealt with, they will be justified.
This vision of the horses portrays the situation of Israel in their captivity. In the eyes of God, Christ the Redeemer was with them taking the lead, and they, God's redeemed people, were following Him. Because they were God's redeemed people, they appear at first sight as red horses. But because they were not pure, they are signified also by the reddish-brown horses. They need to contact God and to be dealt with by Him in order to gain God and be justified by Him and thus become those signified by the white horses. Once they repent, they will swiftly be accepted by God and justified by Him.</p>

<p>G. The Red, Reddish-brown,
and White Horses Having Been Sent
by Jehovah to Go To and Fro on the Earth
"Then I said, What are these, sir? And the angel who spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these are. And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to go to and fro on the earth. And they answered the Angel of Jehovah who was standing among the myrtle trees, and they said, We have gone to and fro on the earth, and behold, all the earth sits still and is quiet" (vv. 9-11). Here we see that the red, reddish- brown, and white horses, signifying those among Israel who were to be redeemed and brought back to God for His justification and acceptance, had been sent by Jehovah to go to and fro on the earth; and they answered the Angel of Jehovah standing among the myrtle trees that they had gone to and fro on the earth and had seen that all the earth sat still and was quiet.
These verses reveal that in addition to Christ, who had been sent as the Redeemer to take care of Israel in their captivity, others had been sent by God to go through the earth to see the situation of the nations. As indicated by the movement of the horses, God's captured people were unsettled and were without peace, rest, and the enjoyment of life. The nations, on the contrary, were sitting still and quiet. This indicates that, in the eyes of God, all the nations around Israel at that time were sitting there enjoying their life in peace and quietness while God's elect were suffering.
H. The Angel of Jehovah Interceding
In verse 12 we see that the Angel of Jehovah interceded for Israel. "Then the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long will You not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant for these seventy years?"
I. Jehovah Answering
the Angel Who Spoke with Zechariah
In verses 13 through 17 we have Jehovah's answer to Christ's intercession for Israel. Jehovah answered the angel who spoke to Zechariah with good words, with comforting words, and the angel said to him, "Cry out, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: I am greatly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion" (v. 14). Because the nations were sitting peacefully while Jerusalem was in trouble, Jehovah was very jealous for Jerusalem. He was extremely angry with the nations, who were at ease, sitting still and quiet (v. 15a). He was only a little angry with Israel, but the nations dealt with Israel excessively (v. 15b).
Verse 16 goes on to say, "Therefore thus says Jehovah, I return to Jerusalem with compassions; My house will be built in it, declares Jehovah of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem." To measure is to possess. For Jehovah to cause a measuring line to be stretched over Jerusalem means that He will possess that city. For seventy years Jerusalem was given up by God. Now He was coming back to repossess the city, so He sent someone to measure it. In verse 17 Jehovah went on to say, "My cities will again overflow with good, and Jehovah will again comfort Zion and will again choose Jerusalem." This is the way Christ's prayer for Israel was answered by God.</p>

<p>B. The Four Horns
"Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there were four horns. And I said to the angel who spoke with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem" (vv. 18-19). These four horns are the four kingdoms with their kings—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire—signified by the great human image in Daniel 2 and by the four beasts in Daniel 7:3-8, which damaged and destroyed the chosen people of God.
C. The Four Craftsmen
"Then Jehovah showed me four craftsmen. And I said, What do these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns that have so scattered Judah that no man lifts up his head, but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it" (vv. 20-21). These four craftsmen are the skills, including the stone not hewn by man's hands, used by God to destroy the four kingdoms, with their kings, that destroyed the nation of Israel. Christ is the One among the craftsmen who will come as the stone cut out without hands to smash the great image.
Each of the first three kingdoms—Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece—was taken over in a skillful way by the kingdom which followed it. Babylon was defeated in one night when Darius the Mede came and defeated Belshazzar. How skillful was Darius! Then, as Daniel 8 reveals, the goat from Macedonia (the Grecian Empire under Alexander the Great) came to trample the ram of Persia. History tells us that Alexander the Great was very skillful. He was one of the craftsmen that dealt with the four horns. Later the Roman Empire came in to deal with Greece. These four empires are the central factors of human history. Eventually, the restored Roman Empire will be smashed into powder by Christ as the top Craftsman.
All four empires devastated and destroyed Israel. But they all have been or, in the case of the restored Roman Empire, will be destroyed by the four craftsmen raised up by God. This is a comforting and encouraging word of promise.</p>

<p>B. A Measuring Line
The measuring line (2:1b) signifies measuring in order to possess. For example, when we buy land or cloth, we may first measure its length and width. After we measure the land or the cloth, we then proceed to possess it.
C. To Measure Jerusalem
The Man with the measuring line intended to measure Jerusalem for the purpose that Jehovah may repossess it (Zech. 2:2, 4b). Jerusalem was given up by God for the seventy years of captivity. After the captivity, God came back to Jerusalem to measure it for His possession. This measuring is not only to know the size but also to know the condition and the situation. The measuring was done by a Man, not by an angel. An angel is unqualified to measure anything human, because he does not have the human nature. Only Jesus, who has both the divine nature and the human nature, is qualified to measure Jerusalem.
Whereas the temple is the sign of God's house, the city of Jerusalem is a sign of God's kingdom for His administration. The city of Jerusalem was measured and was found to be without limit (v. 4). This indicates that the size of God's kingdom is the size of God Himself. Therefore, the measuring has revealed two important matters: that God's kingdom is unlimited and that God Himself is the size of His kingdom.</p>

<p>E. The Crucial Significance
of This Vision to the People of Zion
Zechariah 2:6-13 tells us the crucial significance of this vision to the people of Zion.
1. Jehovah Having Spread Them Out
Like the Four Winds of the Heavens
In verse 6b Jehovah declares concerning His people, "I have spread you out like the four winds of the heavens." We may think that God scattered the people of Israel when they were taken into captivity. However, this verse says not that God scattered them but that He spread them. This is like the spreading of the believers in Acts 8. Thousands of believers were in Jerusalem, but God was not satisfied. A persecution was raised up which scattered them. That persecution was not good, but it brought in a glorious spreading (Acts 11:19). Likewise, if the children of Israel had not been captured, God's testimony would have been limited to the small city of Jerusalem with its temple. But when the children of Israel were scattered to Babylon, four young people became witnesses of God and a testimony for Him. In this way, God's testimony was spread to Babylon. If God's testimony had not come to Babylon, how could people realize that He is able to make the fire in the blazing furnace of none effect and able also to shut the mouths of lions? God is great and sovereign, and He has a broad heart. Therefore, He wanted His testimony to be spread to faraway places.</p>

<p>The first part of verse 8 says, "Thus says Jehovah of hosts, After the glory He has sent Me." Who is the He, and who is the Me? The He refers to God, Jehovah of hosts, and the Me refers also to Jehovah of hosts. Jehovah of hosts sent Jehovah of hosts. This means that Jehovah of hosts is the Sender and the One sent.</p>

<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate Gods but three "hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible" God (Philip Schaff). The Greek word for hypostasis, the singular form of hypostases, is composed of two Greek words: hupo meaning "under" or "below" and stasis meaning "substantial support." Hence, hypostasis refers to a support under, a support beneath, that is, something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead.</p>

<p>In Zechariah 2:8 one of the three in the Godhead sent another of the three. The Sender is called He, and the sent One is called Me. Surely the He refers to the Father, and the Me, to the Son. After the glory, the Triune God decided to do something marvelous. The decision was that the Father would send the Son. This corresponds to what is revealed in John 5 and 6. "He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him" (5:23). "I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" (v. 30). "The works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me" (v. 36b). "The Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me" (v. 37a). "I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" (6:38). "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him" (v. 44a). "The living Father has sent Me" (v. 57a). Zechariah 2 and John 5 and 6 all speak of the Father's sending the Son. Both the Father and the Son are Jehovah.
Christ as the One sent by Jehovah of hosts and as the Sender, Jehovah of hosts, will be against the nations who plunder the people of Zion and touch them as the pupil of His eye. Our eyes are extremely sensitive and immediately react to anything that touches them. "His eye" refers to the Father's eye. God's people are very dear to Him, and whoever touches them touches the pupil of His eye. This was a word of comfort, encouragement, and consolation to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and all the other returned ones.</p>

<p>IV. THE VISION OF JOSHUA
THE HIGH PRIEST PERFECTED, ESTABLISHED,
AND STRENGTHENED BY THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH
WITH ZERUBBABEL THE GOVERNOR OF JUDAH
In the first four chapters of Zechariah, the Angel of Jehovah is taking care of five visions. This implies that Christ as God's sent One is always with God's people taking care of them. In chapter three we have a vision showing us that Joshua the high priest was perfected, established, and strengthened by the Angel of Jehovah with Zerubbabel the governor of Judah. Joshua, a most important leader among God's people, was under the care of the Angel of Jehovah. The way the Angel of Jehovah took care of Joshua was to measure him. Thus, the measuring in chapter two is continued in chapter three. Christ came to measure Joshua and thereby to take care of him.
A. The Angel Showing Zechariah
Joshua the High Priest
The Angel showed Zechariah Joshua the high priest (v. 1a). Joshua typifies Christ as the High Priest sent by God to His people (Heb. 3:1; 4:14-15; 7:26). Joshua represents and signifies Israel as a nation of priests (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-4a).</p>

<ol>
<li>Resisted by Satan Standing at His Right Hand
While Joshua was standing before the Angel of Jehovah, he was resisted by Satan, who was standing at his right hand to accuse him (v. 1b). The word Satan means "the accuser," "the adversary," and it is the base for the word accuse at the end of verse 1. An adversary is an inward enemy. For example, if someone outside your family opposes you, that person will be your enemy. But if a member of your family opposes you, that person will be your adversary. Such an adversary is a more serious threat than an enemy. As the adversary, Satan's intention was to put Joshua down in front of his fellows (v. 8) and to frustrate the rebuilding of God's temple.</li>
<li>
<p>Jehovah's Defense Extended to Him
Verse 2 says, "And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" Jehovah's word here indicates two things. First, it indicates Jehovah's determination to rebuild Jerusalem, since He has chosen her. Second, it indicates that Jehovah would do something for Joshua, since he was a brand plucked from the fire (Amos 4:11; Jude 23a). As the Angel of Jehovah rebuked Satan, He seemed to be saying, "Why have you come here to bother us? I know that you are accusing Joshua and opposing him. I know also that although he is the high priest of My people, he is not that good. He is a brand plucked from the fire, but he is in My hand. Satan, I rebuke you."
In Zechariah 3:1 and 2 we have three parties: Joshua, the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan. In our Christian life, as God's chosen people we are always in this kind of situation. God is in front of us, and the evil one is at our right hand to resist us, to oppose us, to accuse us, and to be our adversary. This is a repetition of the scene in the garden of Eden described in Genesis 2, where God put the man He had created in front of two trees—one denoting God and the other denoting Satan. Zechariah 3 is also a repetition of Genesis 2.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah
Extended to Joshua
Zechariah 3:3-10 shows us how the perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua.
a. Removing the Filthy Garments from Him
"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the Angel. And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you" (vv. 3-4a). Recently, as I was considering how the high priest could still be clothed with filthy garments, I was reminded how even the believers in the church could steal (Eph. 4:28). We may not steal outwardly, but we may inwardly desire something that belongs to someone else. This is covetousness and greediness. Likewise, every day we speak a lot, and the matters we cover in our talk or gossip may be either dirty or with an evil intention to defame others. This is why we must often pray, "Lord, cleanse me. I realize that I am still filthy because I still live in the flesh, which is altogether filthy."
The Angel of Jehovah knew all the things concerning Joshua and did not give Satan any time to accuse. In such a situation Joshua may not have been at peace. Satan was beside him, the dirty garments were upon him, and the Angel of Jehovah was before him. However, the perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua by removing the filthy garments from him, thus making his iniquity pass from him.
b. Clothing Him with Stately Robes
Not only did Joshua's iniquity pass from him, but he was also clothed with "stately robes" (vv. 4b, 5b). A stately robe is a garment that is fitting to one's office and status. For example, judges are clothed with stately robes. Likewise, Joshua was clothed with garments befitting his office and status as high priest.
c. Crowning Him with a Clean Turban upon His Head
"And I said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by" (v. 5). This clean turban signifies that Joshua had been fully cleansed and was now clean in the presence of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>d. Testifying to Him
In verses 6 and 7 Christ as the Angel of Jehovah testified to Joshua. Here testified actually means "charged."
In His charge to Joshua, Christ as the Angel of Jehovah said, "Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If you will walk in My ways and if you will keep My charge, then you will both judge My house and keep My courts, and I will grant you to walk among these standing here." With respect to this charge, I would like to point out that in God's administration among the people of Israel, there were three offices: the priests, the kings, and the prophets. The responsibility of the high priest was to be clear about the matters concerning God's people and to bring these matters to God and wait on God until He enlightened him and gave him a definite answer. The enlightenment and the answer came through the Urim and the Thummim. The high priest, therefore, received God's decision and instruction regarding various situations, and then he passed on the decision and instructions to the king, who was responsible in God's administration to carry them out. We may compare the priest's duty to that of those in the legislative branch of the government, and the king's duty to that of the president in the executive branch. Just as the president is responsible for enforcing the laws passed by the legislature, so the kings in Israel were responsible for carrying out the instructions received from God by the high priest. However, sometimes both the priests and the kings were weak and inadequate. At such times God would raise up the prophets to speak for Him. Here in Zechariah both Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the king were rather weak and somewhat discouraged. Therefore, God used Zechariah the prophet to speak for Him and to strengthen and encourage Joshua and Zerubbabel. The vision in chapter three is related to God's decision concerning Joshua. As we will see, the vision in chapter four is related to Zerubbabel and to his responsibility to carry out God's decision to continue and complete the rebuilding of the temple.
e. Strengthening Him
with Zerubbabel the Governor of Judah
In verses 8 through 10 Christ as the Angel of Jehovah strengthened Joshua with Zerubbabel the governor of Judah (Hag. 1:1, 14).
1) A Type of Christ
Verse 8 says, "Hear then, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you—for they are men of symbol—for, behold, I am bringing forth My Servant, the Shoot." This refers to Zerubbabel who is a type of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, the Shoot of David, in His humanity and royal faithfulness (Zech. 6:12).</p>

<p>2) The Stone That Jehovah Set before Joshua
Zechariah 3:9 goes on to say, "For behold, this is the stone that I have set before Joshua: upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day." This stone (Zerubbabel) set before Joshua also typifies Christ (Isa. 28:16; Matt. 21:42). Zerubbabel was a stone set before Joshua to carry out God's economy.
a) Seven Eyes Being upon This Stone
Upon this one stone (Christ) are seven eyes (Zech. 3:9a; 4:10). These seven eyes signify the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 5:6). Christ is the stone with the seven Spirits as His eyes.
b) Jehovah Engraving the Engraving of the Stone
Jehovah will engrave the engraving of the stone (Zech. 3:9b). This indicates that God will work on Christ as the stone for God's redemption, salvation, and building. To engrave is to cut. When Christ was on the cross, He was engraved, cut, by God.</p>

<p>V. THE VISION OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND
AND THE TWO OLIVE TREES
A. A Vision to Strengthen Zerubbabel
the Governor of Judah in the Kingship
The priesthood and the kingship are the two offices in God's administration among His people. These two offices always go together as a pair and are never separated. The priesthood may be compared to the legislative branch of the government, and the kingship, to the executive branch. In God's administration legislative matters are decided by God Himself through the Urim and the Thummim worn by the high priest. The decisions made known through the priesthood are then executed, carried out, by the kingship.
In the church life today, we need both the priesthood and the kingship. Through the exercise of the priesthood, we are brought into God's presence. Through the exercise of the kingship by the older, experienced ones, the church is saved from anarchy and preserved in a good order. For the church life, we as God's people with His administration must have both the priesthood and the kingship.
One function of the priesthood is to teach us how to worship God and how to have the proper remembrance of the Lord at the Lord's table. We should not worship God or remember the Lord according to our natural concept. In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness." This chapter also shows us that the worship God desires is that we drink of Him as the living water. The more we take God as our living water, the more we worship Him. We drink of God not by exercising our mind but by exercising our spirit. Regarding the remembrance of the Lord at the Lord's table, we also need the instruction of the priesthood. It is crucial for us to realize that the way to remember the Lord is not to exercise our mind to recall everything He did in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection; the way to remember Him is to enjoy Him by eating and drinking of Him. As we partake of the bread and of the cup, we remember Him and worship Him.
The visions in Zechariah 3 and 4 are concerned respectively with the priesthood and the kingship. The previous vision in chapter three concerning Joshua is to strengthen Joshua the high priest in the priesthood. To strengthen Joshua is to strengthen the priesthood and establish it. The vision of the golden lampstand and the two olive trees in chapter four is to strengthen Zerubbabel the governor of Judah in the kingship. Zerubbabel was not a king but a governor in the position of a king. Although Zerubbabel was not actually a king, he was nevertheless a descendant, a shoot, of the royal family of David. In chapter three Joshua was measured, and as a result of that measuring, he was strengthened and established through the cleansing. In chapter four Zerubbabel is measured so that through it he may be strengthened and established. The strengthening of Joshua in the priesthood and of Zerubbabel in the kingship are both for the rebuilding of the temple.</p>

<p>B. The Significance of the Priesthood of Joshua
and the Lampstand of Gold
The priesthood of Joshua signifies the priesthood of the nation of Israel for the nations for God. The lampstand of gold signifies the shining testimony of the nation of Israel toward the nations for God. God had chosen Israel to be a nation of priests (Exo. 19:6). God's intention was to use the nation of Israel as a priesthood to bring the nations to God that they might enter into God's presence to be enlightened, exposed, dealt with, and transfused by God with the divine riches. In addition, the priests were to teach the nations how to worship God and serve God. In order for the priests to do this, they would have to be familiar with God's law and His regulations. In addition to being a nation of priests, Israel was also to be a testimony standing for God. Therefore, in chapter three we have the priesthood, and in chapter four, the lampstand.
C. The Lampstand
The angel who spoke with Zechariah roused him and said to him, "What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, there is a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on top of it and its seven lamps upon it, with seven pipes for each of the lamps on top of it" (Zech. 4:2). The lampstand here signifies the embodiment of the Triune God.
1. Its Substance
The substance of the lampstand is gold, signifying the Father as its source and nature.
2. Its Form
The form of the lampstand being a lampstand signifies the Son as the embodiment.
3. Its Expression
The expression of the lampstand is the seven lamps, signifying the Spirit as the sevenfold intensified expression.
4. Its Supply
The supply of the lampstand is the seven pipes for each of the lamps, signifying the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as its bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19b).
5. Christ, the Nation of Israel,
and the Local Churches
First, Christ is the lampstand as the testimony of God (Exo. 25:31-39). Second, the nation of Israel is the lampstand as the testimony of God. Third, the local churches are the lampstands as the testimony of Christ (Rev. 1:12, 20b).</p>

<p>D. The Two Olive Trees
on the Two Sides of the Lampstand
Zechariah 4:3 says, "There are two olive trees beside it, one to the right of the bowl and one to the left." These two olive trees signify Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor at the time, who were the two sons of oil, filled with the Spirit of Jehovah for the rebuilding of God's temple (vv. 3-6, 12-14). The two sons of oil are also the two witnesses in the last three and a half years of the present age, who will be witnesses of God in the great tribulation for the strengthening of God's peoples—the Israelites and the believers in Christ (Rev. 11:3-12; 12:17). These two witnesses are Moses and Elijah. Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets, both testify for God. The expression "the law and the prophets" (Luke 16:16) refers to the Old Testament. The law is centered in Moses, and the prophets are centered in Elijah. These two, Moses and Elijah, will support and supply the persecuted Israelites and the believers during the great tribulation.
The nation of Israel is the lampstand, signifying God's testimony. God's testimony needs the shining. For this shining there must be the burning, and in order for there to be the burning, there must be the supply of olive oil. In order to have the olive oil, there must be some olive trees. The two olive trees on the two sides of the lampstand are the two sons of oil, Joshua and Zerubbabel.
In Zechariah 4:11 the prophet says to the angel, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?" In verse 12 Zechariah goes on to ask, "What are the two olive branches that are by the side of the two golden spouts, which empty the gold from themselves?" In verse 11 there are two trees, and in verse 12, two branches. The two branches are part of the two trees. When the bowl of the lampstand is void of oil, the two trees will supply oil by flowing it out through the branches and into the two spouts. The oil will then flow from the spouts into the bowl, and from the bowl into the lampstand.
The relative pronoun which in verse 12 refers not to the spouts but to the branches. These branches "empty the gold from themselves." To empty the gold is to cause the gold to flow out. The word gold here refers to the oil. The oil and the gold are one. The oil denotes the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. Furthermore, in typology gold signifies God. The gold that fills the bowl is the Spirit; the Spirit is God; and God is typified by gold. As we apply this matter to our experience today, we see that the Spirit who flows out of us is God, and God is gold. Thus, when we minister Christ to others, supplying them with oil, we are actually supplying them with God. God is flowing out from us into them. We all should be olive trees emptying God from ourselves into others. In this way oil will be provided to the needy by those who are olive trees out of which God is flowing.
Let us consider further why the two trees are called two branches. In Zechariah 3 and 4 the same person, Zerubbabel, is signified by a shoot (3:8), a tree (4:3, 11), and a branch (v. 12). This indicates that Zerubbabel himself is not the source. If he were a tree complete in himself, he would be the source. However, he is a tree which is actually a branch of another tree, and that tree is the source. Moreover, Zerubbabel is also a shoot from the other tree. That tree is Christ. Christ is the unique olive tree, and both Zerubbabel and we ourselves are branches, offshoots, of Christ. To branch out is to be an offshoot. Although Christ is the unique olive tree, out from Him many shoots have issued forth. The issuing forth of these shoots is Christ's branching out. These branches, or shoots, are now the many olive trees on earth today. Are you not such an olive tree? As bona fide Christians, we are olive trees. Strictly speaking, we are olive trees not in the sense of being separate trees but in the sense of being branches of Christ, the unique olive tree. As branches we need to supply others with oil, that is, with the Spirit, that they may be enlivened. Praise the Lord that in Christ we are olive trees supplying others with the sevenfold Spirit!</p>

<p>E. Zerubbabel, the Governor of Judah,
Who Laid the Foundation
of the Rebuilding of the Temple,
Bringing Forth the Topstone
"The angel who spoke with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir. And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts. Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will bring forth the topstone with shouts of Grace, grace to it....The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it" (vv. 5-7, 9a). Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, who laid the foundation of the rebuilding of the temple, will bring forth the topstone, indicating that he will finish the rebuilding of God's temple by the Spirit of Jehovah, not by might nor by power. The prophet Zechariah spoke this word to Zerubbabel in order to support, encourage, strengthen, and establish the hand of Zerubbabel that he might continue the building of the temple unto its consummation.
Whereas chapter three refers to Christ's death for redemption, chapter four speaks of the Spirit for the carrying out of God's economy. According to the New Testament, Christ's death for our redemption is followed by the Spirit. Today we should not only minister Christ to others but also supply them with the Spirit. The Christ we minister is the One who was crucified, who was raised from among the dead, and who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As we speak to others concerning Christ, we should supply them with the Spirit.
F. The Topstone with Shouts of Grace
The topstone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!" signifies Christ, who is the grace as the stone, upon which are the seven eyes of Jehovah, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God for the completion of the rebuilding of God's temple (3:9; 4:7-10; Rev. 5:6). To bring forth the topstone is to complete the building. This topstone is a type of Christ. For God's building Christ is a stone in three aspects. Christ is the foundation stone to uphold God's building (Isa. 28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11), the cornerstone to join together the Gentile and Jewish members of His Body (Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:6), and the topstone to consummate everything of God's building.
The shouts of "Grace, grace to it!" indicate that the topstone itself is grace. The topstone is grace from God to us, and this grace is Christ. "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us..full of grace and reality" (John 1:14). This reveals that in His incarnation Christ brought God to us first as grace and then as reality. Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son. When God is enjoyed by us, we have grace. When God is realized by us, we have reality. Both grace and reality are Christ. The topstone is therefore the Christ who is the grace from God to us to be the covering of God's building.
Zechariah 4:10 says, "Who has despised the day of small things? For they rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, these seven; they are the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth." "These seven," which are the "eyes of Jehovah," are the seven eyes upon the stone in 3:9. Revelation 5:6 speaks of a Lamb with "seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God." The seven eyes of the stone are the seven eyes of Jehovah and also the seven eyes of the Lamb, Christ. It is crucial for us to realize that the stone, Jehovah, and the Lamb are one. Christ the Lamb is the stone, and He is also Jehovah. Thus the seven eyes of the stone and the seven eyes of Jehovah are the seven eyes of Christ. According to Revelation 5:6, these seven eyes are the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ. This means that the Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ. This indicates that Christ and the Holy Spirit, although distinct, are not separate. Just as our eyes are essentially one with our body, so the Holy Spirit is essentially one with Christ.
Christ is the stone engraved by God the Father (Zech. 3:9). The engraved One is Christ, and the engraving One is the Father. Although the Father and the Son are distinct, they are essentially one in the accomplishment of eternal redemption. As the result of this redemption, we may now enjoy Christ as the Spirit, even as the sevenfold intensified Spirit. According to Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 13:14, we have the love of God the Father as the source, the grace of Christ as the course, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as the transmission for our enjoyment. From all this we see that redemption has been accomplished by the Son, and now the Spirit is supplied to us for God's building. By the Spirit the building of the church will be consummated.</p>

<p>D. The Significance of Stealing
Verses 3b and 4b speak of those who steal. Stealing signifies sins toward man, which are the issue of covetousness. Stealing issues from greed and covetousness. Today is an age of stealing. Business and trade involve stealing. Everyone is greedy and full of covetousness. The apostle Paul could keep many of the Ten Commandments, but he could not fulfill the commandment concerning coveting (Rom. 7:7-8).</p>

<p>VII. THE VISION OF THE EPHAH VESSEL
Verses 5 through 11 describe the vision of the ephah vessel, which is the measuring vessel, a container able to hold one ephah, used for purchasing and selling in business.
A. Its Appearance in All the Land
"Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their appearance in all the land" (vv. 5-6). A large percentage of the world's population is engaged in business or commerce. The appearance of business is not that bad; rather, in all the land commerce seems to have a proper appearance. But as we will see, actually today's commerce is totally wicked.
B. A Woman Sitting within the Ephah Vessel
"This is a woman sitting within the ephah vessel. Then he said, This is Wickedness" (vv. 7b-8a). This reveals that the woman sitting within the ephah vessel signifies the wickedness contained in commerce, such as covetousness, deceit, and the love of mammon. The seller loves money and tries to get money out of the buyer's pocket; the buyer also loves money and tries to obtain the things he wants at a low price, thereby saving money.
The vision in Zechariah 5 corresponds to that of Babylon the Great in Revelation 18. These visions show us that in the sight of God the wickedness contained in commerce is a kind of idolatry and fornication. Business is an adulterous woman desirous of making money.
C. A Lead Cover Thrown
over the Opening of the Ephah Vessel
In Zechariah 5:7 and 8 we see that a lead cover, a lead weight, is thrown over the opening of the ephah vessel. This signifies the restriction of the wickedness in commerce by God's sovereignty. Wickedness is hidden and concealed in international trade. If commerce, especially international trade, could be restricted, the whole earth would be holy.
D. Two Women Going Forth
"Then I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and behold, there were two women going forth" (v. 9a). The one woman becoming two women signifies the double effect of commerce once it becomes free of the restriction.</p>

<p>E. Two Women Lifting Up the Ephah Vessel
between the Earth and the Heavens
The two women had wings like the wings of a stork, and the wind was in their wings. They lifted up the ephah vessel between the earth and the heavens (v. 9b). All this signifies the rapid spreading of the wicked commerce.
F. A House Built for the Woman
in the Land of Shinar
"I said to the angel who spoke with me, Where are they taking the ephah vessel? And he said to me, To build a house for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place" (vv. 10-11). This signifies that God's sovereignty will cause the wickedness in business, which the people of Israel learned of the Babylonians in their captivity, to go back to Babylon (the land of Shinar). Let this wickedness return to Babylon. All the people among God's elect should be honest and simple in their living.</p>

<p>VIII. THE VISION OF THE FOUR CHARIOTS
In 6:1-8 we have the last of the eight visions in the book of Zechariah—the vision of the four chariots.
A. The Significance of the Four Chariots
"Then I lifted up my eyes again and I saw, and behold, there were four chariots coming forth from between the two mountains" (6:1a). These four chariots signify the four winds (vv. 4-8) from the four corners of the earth (Rev. 7:1-3) for God's judgment of sins upon the earth. These four winds are used by God to carry out His administration in the entire universe. In particular, they are used by God to carry out His judgment, not mainly on people but on nations, governments, and kingdoms.
In the vision in Zechariah 1:18-21, Zechariah saw four horns which were raised up to damage and destroy God's people Israel. Then God prepared four "craftsmen" to destroy these four horns. The first of these craftsmen was the Persian Empire, sovereignly used by God to destroy Babylon, the first horn. Persia was a great empire; its territory stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. Surely it was not easy for anyone to conquer that vast empire. But Alexander the Great, a young man, came and swiftly defeated all of the Persian Empire. This was all under God's sovereign blowing of the wind to produce the second craftsman in order to destroy the second horn. Then Julius Caesar came with the Roman army and in a short time conquered the Grecian Empire, founded by Alexander. The Roman Empire, the last horn, has now lasted for over two thousand years.</p>

<ol>
<li>Each Chariot Being Equipped with Horses
"With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot were black horses, and with the third chariot were white horses, and with the fourth chariot were strong, speckled horses" (6:2-3). That each chariot was equipped with horses signifies the quick movement of God's judgment. From our point of view, God's judgment may be slow in coming. However, according to God's view, His judgment comes swiftly with a quick movement.

<ol>
<li>Horses of Different Colors
These horses of different colors, red, black, white, and speckled, signify the different manners of God's judgment.
When the Lord Jesus comes, He will be swifter than the wind; He will be like lightning. The last wind will bring in Christ as the last, the consummating, Craftsman, who will destroy Antichrist with his kingdom and tread the great winepress. In an instant He will crush the great human image (Dan. 2) from the toes to the head, terminating the entire human government on this earth.
B. The Significance of the Two Mountains
Zechariah 6:1 speaks of two mountains. These two mountains signify a testimony of God's judgments on the earth. From between the two mountains, the four winds come forth to testify to the whole earth that God is on the throne and that the earth is under His administration.
C. The Significance of the Mountains of Brass
"The mountains were mountains of brass" (v. 1b). In typology brass signifies judgment. Thus, these two mountains of brass signify mountains of judgment. God's judgment comes to carry out His testimony.
D. These Who Are Going Forth
to the Land of the North Giving Rest
to God's Spirit in the Land of the North
"Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying, See, these who are going forth to the land of the north have given My Spirit rest in the land of the north" (v. 8). This signifies that the judgments on the countries of the north, Assyria and Babylon (Jer. 1:14-15; 4:6; 6:1; 25:9; 46:10; Ezek. 1:4), have given rest to God's Spirit. The judgment on these countries was a comfort to God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In Zechariah 6:9-13 both Joshua and Zerubbabel are a type of Christ. This means that two persons typify one person. Christ is the unique One to hold the two offices, the priesthood and the kingship. When He comes, He will put the priesthood and the kingship together on His shoulders. In all of history He is the only person who is qualified to bear the responsibilities of these two offices in God's administration. Thus, in Hebrews 7 Christ is both the High Priest and the King, as typified by Melchizedek. In Genesis 14 Melchizedek was first a king, and then he came as a priest to Abraham, ministering the bread and the wine. This indicates that he was both a king and a priest. Because Melchizedek bore both offices, he was a type of Christ as the One who would bear both the priesthood and the kingship in God's administration.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jehovah of Hosts Being Jealous
for Zion with a Great Jealousy
Jehovah of hosts is jealous for Zion with a great jealousy. Indeed, He is jealous for her with great wrath to her enemies (v. 2). Although God is love, He nevertheless has great wrath toward the enemies of His people. He is jealous for His beloved elect.</p></li>
<li><p>Jehovah Returning to Zion
and Dwelling within Jerusalem
Jehovah returns to Zion, and He will dwell within Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, the Holy Mountain (v. 3).</p></li>
<li>Old Men and Old Women
Dwelling in the Streets of Jerusalem
Old men and old women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, each with his staff in his hand due to the multitude of his days (v. 4). This indicates that the city will be in a marvelous situation and that the old men and old women will have the real enjoyment of life.</li>
<li>The Streets of the City
Being Full of Boys and Girls Playing
The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing (v. 5). This indicates that the city will be peaceful and very pleasant.</li>
</ol>

<p>B. The Nations Coming to Israel
to Entreat the Favor of Jehovah,
and the Children of Israel Being Priests to Them
The nations will come to Israel to entreat the favor, the grace, of Jehovah, and the children of Israel will be priests to them (vv. 20-23). By this time the entire nation of Israel will be a priesthood. They will teach the Gentiles, the nations, to know God's way and God's person, and they will teach them to worship and serve God. As priests, they will bring the nations into the presence of God that they may be enlightened, corrected, and favored with all the riches of God. This is the priesthood. In the one thousand years of the kingdom, after the Jews are saved at the Lord's coming back, they will become the priests to teach all the repentant nations.
1. Peoples, Even the Inhabitants
of Many Cities, Coming to Israel
Not just one kind of people but peoples, even the inhabitants of many cities from different countries, will come to Israel and say, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor [grace] of Jehovah and to seek Jehovah of hosts; and the other: I will go, too" (v. 21). Verse 22 goes on to say, "Indeed, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Jehovah." I hope that one day in all the local churches the situation will be like this. Whenever someone would say, "Let us go to the meeting," another would say, "I will go, too." This will be the situation in the millennium. Not only all the people of Israel but also the Gentiles who are living with them will seek God.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ten Men Taking Hold
of the Skirt of a Jewish Man
and Saying That They Will Go with Him
In those days, from all the languages of the nations, ten men will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you" (v. 23; Isa. 2:2-3a). In some way God will reverse the situation of Babel and deal with the problem caused by the different languages among the nations. God did this once already, at Pentecost (Acts 2). What happened at Pentecost is a prefigure of what will take place during the age of the millennial kingdom.

<ol>
<li>The Children of Israel
Being Priests to the Nations
The children of Israel will be priests to the nations (Isa. 2:3b-4a). God's intention according to Exodus 19:6 was to have Israel as a nation of priests, and He has never forgotten this. God has been waiting for an opportune time to do this, but there has not yet been the chance for God to do it. In the time of the restoration, all the Israelites will be priests. They will be very busy as priests to the nations, teaching them how to worship and serve Jehovah. The nations were formerly idol worshippers or atheists, but they all will turn to God, and God will turn to them to be their God. Therefore, they will need to learn how to worship and serve Jehovah.
This was the encouraging word spoken to the children of Israel. Zechariah seemed to be saying, "Forget about fasting and weeping. Turn to God and turn to a godly life. Then a time of restoration will come among you, and the nations will turn to you and will come to dwell with you as God's people. You will take the lead to help them, to teach them, to usher them into the worship of God."
During the millennial kingdom, Israel will be in the earthly part, whereas we, the New Testament believers, will be in the heavenly part. We will be the kings, the co-kings with Christ, and we will also be the priests, the heavenly priests, to serve God. However, not all of the believers will be there but only the overcoming believers. Whether or not the millennium will be a time of testing for us will depend on whether or not we have been overcomers in our Christian life in this age. If we are the overcomers, we will be in the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom as kings and priests. If not, we will be in some other place to be disciplined and to become matured.</li>

<p>THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT
(1)
Scripture Reading: Zech. 9
Zechariah's burden was to help the returned people of Israel to see God's purpose. At that time God's purpose was to recover the temple as the center of His interest. Through Zechariah the Lord seemed to be saying to them, "I do not want your fasting and weeping. Forget about these things. I would even ask you to forget what I did in the past to deal with you. You need to know what I want you to do today. I want you to realize that My desire is that the temple would be built up by My people to be the center and reality of My interest on earth." Today God's intention, His desire, is that we would be one with Him. He has brought us back to the very site, to the ground, even to the foundation of the temple. God wants us to see that His interest, desire, and burden are to finish the building of this temple.
God has a burden. This burden is that He may gain a people in this age to know His heart, to realize His desire, and to be one with Him to build up the Body of Christ. This is what God wants. God's desire is related to His economy. God's economy is to have Christ as everything, to have Him as the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God's move on this earth. We all need to see this.
Throughout the book of Zechariah Christ is revealed. In chapter one we see Christ as the Man riding on a red horse to take care of God's suffering people; in chapter two, as the One who is measuring Jerusalem; in chapter three, as the One, the High Priest, typified by Joshua the high priest and signified by the stone with seven eyes; in chapter four, as the One, the real King, typified by Zerubbabel; and in chapter six, as the unique One who is qualified to bear the office of both the priesthood and the kingship for the consummation of the building up of God's temple. Now we must go on to see that this all-inclusive Christ is altogether wrapped up with human history. Human history from Adam to the last person of the human race is nothing without Christ. However, according to God's economy, Christ is intimately involved with human history. This means that Christ is wrapped up with every crucial aspect of the four empires signified by the great human image in Daniel 2. As we will see, the Christ revealed in Zechariah 9—14 is a Christ who is involved with human history in a fine, particular, and even intimate way.
The visions in chapters one through six of Zechariah were mainly for consolation to the children of Israel, whereas the prophecies in chapters nine through fourteen are mainly for their encouragement. Without Christ there is neither consolation nor encouragement. The consolation in Zechariah 1—6 is Christ, and the encouragement in Zechariah 9—14 is also Christ. In this message we will consider the first of the prophecies of encouragement.</p>

<p>B. The Lord Protecting Jerusalem
with Its Temple as His House
Zechariah 9:8 says, "I will encamp around My house because of an army, / Because of him who passes by and returns; / And no oppressor will pass over them any more; / For now I see with My eyes." This reveals that during the attack of Alexander the Great, the Lord protected Jerusalem with its temple as His house. Although Alexander, a mighty king, caused damage to so many nations around Judah, he did not cause much damage to Judah and Jerusalem, and he did not damage the temple at all.
C. Christ Being Temporarily Welcomed
as the King into Jerusalem in a Lowly Form
The two verses in chapter nine that are concerned with Christ, verses 9 and 10, are an insertion. This means that verse 11 is actually the continuation of verse 8. Verse 9 says, "Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation; / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey." This reveals that Christ would come in a righteous way with salvation for us and that He would ride upon a donkey, even a colt of a donkey. This verse was fulfilled in the four Gospels when Jesus Christ came into Jerusalem the last time. He came as a King, but as a lowly King, a humiliated King, riding not on a majestic horse but on a colt.</p>

<p>E. Concerning the Victory of the Jewish
Maccabean Heroes over Antiochus Epiphanes
The prophecy in verses 11 through 17 of Zechariah 9 concerns the victory of the Jewish Maccabean heroes over Antiochus Epiphanes, the king of Syria (175-163 B.C.), the kingdom of the north, prophesied by Daniel in his book in 8:9-14, 23-25 and 11:28-35. Antiochus Epiphanes was the first type of the coming Antichrist, who will do the evil things prophesied in Daniel 8:10-13, 23-25; 11:30-32a.
God raised up the Maccabean heroes to encounter Antiochus and to defeat him. Daniel 11:32b says, "The people who know their God will show strength and take action." I believe that Maccabeus and his followers knew that this word applied to themselves and that they were encouraged by it. They showed strength and took action against Antiochus Epiphanes.
Zechariah 9:13 says, "I will bend Judah for Myself, / And I will fill a bow with Ephraim; / And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, / Against your sons, O Javan; / And I will make you like a warrior's sword." The word Javan here refers to Greece and is the key to understanding verses 11 through 17. The sons of Greece are Antiochus and those with him, and the sons of Zion are the Maccabeans. Thus, verse 13 is saying that at the time of Antiochus Epiphanes God would stir up His sons, the sons of Zion, against the sons of Greece.
Verses 14 and 15 go on to say, "And Jehovah will appear above them, / And His arrow will go forth like lightning; / And the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, / And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south. / Jehovah of hosts will defend them; / And they will devour and trample the sling stones. / And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine; / And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, / Like the corners of the altar." In these verses them and they refer to the Maccabeans, who were to be defended by God.
Verse 16 continues, "Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of His people, / For they will be like the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land." "That day" refers to December 25, 161 B.C.
Verse 17 concludes, "For how great is their goodness, and how great their beauty! / Grain will make the young men flourish, / And new wine, the virgins." This is a word spoken in congratulations to the Maccabeans for their victory.
The first part of this chapter is concerned with Alexander the Great, and the last part, with Antiochus Epiphanes. A word concerning Christ, who is wrapped up with human history, is inserted in verses 9 and 10. Christ, of course, did not come during the time of the Grecian Empire but during the time of the Roman Empire. As we will see in a later message, Zechariah also prophesied concerning the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Today we have a wonderful practice in the church life. We encourage every saint to prophesy; we make every saint a prophet. In the Lord's move among His people today, the most important thing is to speak for Him. Paul encouraged all the saints to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1, 24, 31, 39a).</p>

<p>This portion of the Word speaks about the Shepherd of God's flock. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a shepherd. He came as the real Shepherd and blamed the other shepherds, who were the elders, the scribes, and the priests. They were the wrong shepherds, but the Lord Jesus was the unique Shepherd. He even told us that He was the good Shepherd who gave up His life for the sheep (John 10:11, 14-15). On the one hand, the Lord punished the false shepherds; on the other hand, He, the real Shepherd, has visited His flock.</p>
